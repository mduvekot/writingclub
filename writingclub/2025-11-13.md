I am such bad writer. 

I wish I could make you forget what you have just read.

When I find something enjoyable to read, I read a sentence, and that sentence makes me want to read the next sentence that makes me want to read the next sentence and so on until after a while, I begin to feel that the story is going somewhere worthwhile. 

I have no sense of direction. 

I wouldn't want to read the next sentence of this piece, but would you? 

 It's not even that my writing lacks structure, it lacks direction, it doesn't even have a point. 
 
 My writing has no focus. 
 
 If my writing was merely fragmented it would be scatter, but without weight or size, it's more dust than substance. 
 
 I have no ideas of my own worth considering. 
 
 Everything I write is a response to someone else's ideas, which I do not understand. 
 
 If I had received an education, I might have had some credibility, but I deserved neither, never having made an effort for anything that didn't come easy. 
 
 I am profoundly lazy. 
 
 I have no ability for recall, for example, I could not tell you what happened in a movie I just saw. 

 I listen to songs without hearing the lyrics.   
 
 %%I don't read like the rest of us%%
 
 I read very fast, so I only pick up the tone or mood. 

I have no idea what people like.
 
 I do not understand why people like the things they do and  don't share their preferences.  
 
 In my criticism I am incapable of charity.  
 
 Another's point of view is obtuse to me, a result of my near-sightedness. 
 
 I have impeccable taste, but don't like anything at all. 
 
 My first response to any writing is that it must be wrong or—when I don't understand it—nonsense. 
 
 I am distrustful of writer's motives. 
 
 We have enough to think about and not enough to do our thinking with. 
 
 Why would I add any ideas add to a world that already has too many? 
 
 Why anything matters at all is beyond me. 
 
 I have no sense of what is important. 
 
 I am easily distracted by the most trivial. 
 
 I see meaningless connections before I notice meaningful ones. 
 
 I make meaning out of bits of nothing (filaments), yet am blind to the main strands (fibre) of thought. 
 
 I don't make notes and I dislike other people's notes enough that I will take an eraser to pencilled marginalia in library books. 
 
 I have no conceptual framework to help me think. 
 
 I have no coherent world view. 
 
 I neither know nor believe anything. 
 
 I cannot describe myself. 
 
 Ask me what I am:  "A nothing". 
 
 I read something, it impresses and intimidates me—because I can't follow the argument or reconstruct it from first principles, later I'll read something that that contradicts what I read earlier and I'll be in thrall of the new thing. 
 
 Everything flows by me, but nothing sticks. 
 
 I refuse to be understood, I would be to subject myself to humiliation. 
 
 While I remain misunderstood, I am not-yet-wrong. 
 
 I have no moral clarity. 
 
 I am neither objective nor biased, in that I do not have any bias that would reveal a point of view—I have all the biases.
