Let apply Themerson's method (semantic poetry) to the sentence

"The printing press democratized knowledge."

The (determiner used before a singular noun to refer to all the things or people represented by that noun) 
printing press (a machine that prints books, newspapers, or magazines)
democratized (to make countries or organizations use democratic(based on the principles of democracy(an organization or group whose members all have the right to join in making decisions and have their opinions heard, or a system of controlling an organization or group in this way)) ways of making decisions)
knowledge (understanding of or information about a subject that you get by experience or study, either known by one person or by people generally)

that becomes: 

"Machines that printed books, newspapers or magazines made people generally understand  information about a subject."

Sure, the machines did that, starting in 1450 CE. All without paper, or letters.

The Incunabula Short Title Catalogue (ISTC) lists 30,596 produced in the second half of the 15 the century.  In the first 50 years after 1450 approximately 9,000,000 were printed, of which some 450,000 remain. But how many books were there BEFORE 1450? +/- 1,000,000.

we should stop calling commoditization democratization.
