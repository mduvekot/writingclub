On LinkedIn (OK, who reads that?) you can read things like:The "perfect" tool is the one that it's available by the client and solves their problems.About that. No, the perfect tool is not whatever you happen to have at hand. A swiss army knife is a bad screwdriver. A wrench is not a a good substitute for a hammer. A nail gun is a substitute for a hammer. It makes putting nails in lumber much faster, but if you use a nail gun, you'll STILL use a hammer when the head of the nail is not quite flush with the piece. You'll use the claw to pull out a misfired nail. You'll use something like a palm nailer when there's no space.  You'll use a specific type on nailer, a finish nailer or a framing nailer or a roofing nailer.  You cannot rip a piece of lumber with a  nailer or a hammer., that;'s wahat a (again, specialized) saw is forA thing that you call a tool is not a tool if it can be replaced by anything.A tool cannot be replaced by another unless it is a more specific tool."Tool" has many synonyms, but only one antonym—toy. Software applications are not tools. You can substitute Excel with Google Sheets or Numbers or Open Office. They're the supposedly the same thing, just from a different vendor. But if you know how to use one, you do not know how to use the other.  But a Bostich Framing nailer is almost the same as a Metabo, or a Paslode, or a Milwaukee. Even if one is pneumatic, the other cordless and another gas-powered, it takes no effort to switch between them.A tool is so narrowly defined by its use that variation is almost non-existent. Sure, I might prefer a Stiletto hammer to an Estwing, but they are completely equivalent on the job. I can replace one with the other instantly and not experience any delay or other difficulty on the job.  Not so with software. Software has a use-paradigm that is not transparent across categories of vendors.  Perhaps, you might say, software better described as a collection of tools, and a spreadsheet for example has a function that calculates the mean of set of values, and all spreadsheets have that same function. Once you know what a mean is, you can use that anywhere. Except that each mean() might be implemented differently. Does the mean() take one single vector as an argument, or a list, or just two floats? And do they return the arithmetic mean, or the geometric mean, or the harmonic mean? A utensil is not a tool. Why not? Both are implements. [Carus](https://archive.org/details/philosophytool00carugoog) says Lazarus Geiger has proposed a good classification of human activities. He distinguishes between tools, utensils, and weapons. " Those three categories form an analogon to the famous conception of the Hindu religion according to which the active All-being of the world manifests itself in three factors, as Brahma the creator, Vishnu the conservator and sustainer, and Siwa the destroyer. "The tool corresponds to the creative principle. The utensil serves the preservation of life."  Per Carus: A tool is any implement employed for rendering work effective. 
Tool (hammer): creative principle
Utensil (table, cup); conservation
Weapon: destructionGeiger uses the terms "Geräthe", "Werkzeuge" und "Waffen", Carus uses "Utensils", "Tools", "Weapons".It's interesting that today we use the word appliance for the machine equivalent of a utensil, a (domestic) implement. Electrical cooking appliances—..including coffee percolators, toasters, chafing dishes, [etc.]. Maclean's February 163/1# Tools impose rules
Felienne Hermans (The Good Robot podcast) observes: “People from clans around the languages, they speak to the machine. And I thought that was so beautiful because that is absolutely something that's happening in program. People will identify with their programming language. They will have t-shirts like, I'm a Java programmer. And they will have stickers on their laptops. And there's a programming language called Rust. And people call themselves Ruststations[sic]. %%she says Rustaceans%% And they identify as that. They put this on t-shirts and tote bags and laptops. So it's not just a tool. It is a club that you get to be a member of. And then of course with any club will always come both community and exclusion.” [Felienne Hermans](From The Good Robot: Can Programming Languages be Feminist? with Felienne Hermans, Nov 11, 2025) # Tools make assumptions
Tools make assumptions/have preconditions that are implemented as "rules". You must obey those rules or the tool will not work. Failure to obey the rules results in an exception. The definition of an exception is based on the observation that each procedure  has a precondition, a set of circumstances for which it will terminate "normally".[wp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling) 

# Tools are not neutral

## tools are profane
Under Mosaic law, tools defile the sanctity of natural objects:

> And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. Exodus 20:25 

**Hesiod,** _**Works and Days**_**:** Tools are bound up with the curse of toil after Prometheus’ theft of fire. Labour with tools is not neutral but a mark of fallen human condition.

# Interfaces are tools
Let's consider software tools. My browser has Tools > Browser Tools > Developer Tools > 
* Inspector 
* Console
* Debugger
* Network
* Style Editor
* Performance
* Memory
* Storage
* Accessibility
* ApplicationThese are mediating devices, or interfaces, The console can translate symbolic representation of actions into functions/instructions that operate on modelled representations–the DOM) of the web page that I am  looking at.  The mediation is between your intention and a **constructed environment**, not between you and the world itself. %%don;t bring this up iuntil after we've introduced Ihde%%### Carus vs. Heidegger- **Carus:** Tools converge toward prototypes because there is a most efficient way to perform the act. The prototype embodies the essence of the activity.
- **Heidegger:** Tools uncover the world by withdrawing into use. Their essence is not efficiency but their role in a network of practices. Some hundred years ago, the director of the Gazelle bicycle factory claimed %% find that quote again %% that bicycles had reached their ideal form and could not be made any more perfect.The assumption that there was such a prototype form seems to have been pretty common back then. The bikes that Gazelle  made back then still exist, as "retro bikes", nearly unchanged.  But they've added new categories of more specialized bicycles. These don't have the same essence. A hundred years ago, the essence of a bicycle was that it was human-powered. If we are "essentialists", we have to confront the fact that the emergence of e-bikes has either changed the essence of what a bike is, or that they are (essentially) not bicycles.# Kinds of tools for:
* transforming things
* manipulating things
* measuring (phenomena/things)
* thinking 
* conceptualizing
* calculating
* controlling (a process/behaviour)
* sensemaking
* modeling# Means, methods, ends
If a tool is a means to an end, we can ask how the means are used to achieve the end: with skill. When the textile frames rationally demanded child labour, it was because skill was no longer required. The machine required a cheap operator, not a skilled crafts(man). There are (broadly)three constituent components to the cost of production, material, labour, equipment. It makes rational sense to scale by shifting expenditures from skilled labour to machinery, because labour scales only linearly, but machinery scales non-linearly %%No, it doesn't, you need to increase utilization%% ### Concrete numbers for the exampleSet tangible values for a single 8‑hour shift:- **Material per unit:** m=0.50m = 0.50
    
- **Adult wage:** Wa=16.00W_a = 16.00 (i.e., $2/hour × 8 hours)
    
- **Child wage:** Wc=3.20W_c = 3.20 (one‑fifth of adult)
    
- **Adult output per shift:** qa=5q_a = 5 units
    
- **Machine output:** qm=20⋅5=100q_m = 20 \cdot 5 = 100 units
    
- **Equipment amortized per shift:** A=200.00A = 200.00 (capital recovery + maintenance)
    Compute unit costs:- Manual:
    UCmanual=0.50+16.005=0.50+3.20=3.70UC_{\text{manual}} = 0.50 + \frac{16.00}{5} = 0.50 + 3.20 = 3.70- Machine:
    UCmachine=0.50+3.20+200.00100=0.50+2.032=2.532UC_{\text{machine}} = 0.50 + \frac{3.20 + 200.00}{100} = 0.50 + 2.032 = 2.532Direct answer: unit cost drops from $3.70 to $2.532 for the same output level when shifting from 20 skilled adults to one machine plus a child operator.# On skill in prompt engineering
Selling "prompt engineering" as a valuable skill is how the proponents of LLM try to establish that LLMs are legitimate tools. Tool use requires skill. If it does not, require a skill, de-skilling devalues the labour, like the textile frame demanded  child labour. Curious: Why would anyone want to increase the labour cost of LLM use? To sell subscriptions?“You must be prompting it wrong” shifts the blame for failure to produce valuable output from the vendor to the client. Since users donot (and cannot) understand what the LLM does, assigning blame for malfuctioning always works, no matter how skilled or competent the user. The more skilled users are more likely to question their own  work, while the less skilled users won't question the output of the LLM. So the vendor always wins. The opacity of the system guarantees that blame can always be reassigned to the user. %% In the causal relationship, re Heideggers "Schuld. i.e. repsonsability the human in the loop is the scapegoat" responsibility without control%%Peter Thiel seems to be worried that the tech billionaires will be be scapegoated (per Rene Girard), so he's looking for a scapegoat (Greta Thunberg?) 
# On good-enough
Günther sees a "Promethean Gap" between flawed/variable human output and invariant/perfect machine output and the tendency to try to make humans become more like machines. Chatbots exacerbate this, the machine becomes more  human-like, emphasizing their flawed/variable human output while the human is left "in the loop" to verify the output and correct for the good-enough of the machine. # On categories
A knife is a tool, a utensil and a weapon. # Fun stuff
A female wolf has been doing something unusual on the Central Coast of British Columbia. She's learned to pull crab traps up from the water, yanking on a rope to bring it to the surface. But is it tool use?This meets the the most standard definition of tool use used in primatology (Beck 1980), and it surprises me how many don’t think it qualifies as tool use? [Michell A. Rodrigues](https://bsky.app/profile/marspidermonkey.bsky.social/post/3m5x6erzt622q)Benjamin B. Beck _Animal Tool Behavior: The Use and Manufacture of Tools by Animals_ 1980 Garland STPM Press (New York)> "The external employment of an unattached environmental object to alter more efficiently the form, position, or condition of another object, another organism, or the user itself."St Amant & Horton (2008):**> _“Tool use is the exertion of control over a freely manipulable external object (the tool) with the goal of altering the physical properties of another object, substance, surface or medium (the target, which may be the tool user or another organism), via a dynamic mechanical interaction.”_My cat likes grooming with a toothbrush. So much so, she'll use it to show me what she wants. She has a notion of efficiency: "you do it, you're better at it" But if she had paws that made it possible, OR a toothbrush that had been designed for an agent with a paw-shaped hand "disability", she would use it as a grooming tool. If cats had more dexterous paws (or the tool was adapted to their morphology), then grooming with a toothbrush would clearly qualify as tool use under both Beck (1980) and St Amant & Horton# on using words for toolsWe use use a **saw** (concrete noun) to cut wood.When you're **sawing** (present participle) you become someone who **saws** (third-person singular simple present indicative of saw).

# on relationships 
The relationship we have with utensils in particular, is %%what shall we cal this?%%  prosthetic emboduyment? %%Domn Ihde%% A hammer allows me to apply an amount pressure to surface that my hand cannot. The length of the handle __extends__, it effectively makes my arms longer, which gives me more %%fiil in%%. A set of tweezers  __shrinks__ if my fingers to grab something that is too small for my fingers. We could come up with a whole catalog of modifications: extension, reduction, amplification, precision, mediation. We don';t have such relationships with modern tools. Their operation is opaque; but also completely different. They way people perform mental arithmatic doesn't resemble what a digital calculator does. The relationship with calculator compared to a hammer is not extensional/prosthetic %%that means something else, fidna better word%% but delegated and substitutive; it replaces  AND obfuscates. It removes haptic feedback;  an error (hit finger, not nail) is no longer embodied.   ## relationship with the worldIn  hammer-like tool the relationship between the tool and its subject (the thing it is used ON) is direct physical and material, in a calculator, since there is no physical object 7, or 8 or 15 the tool operates on a representamen, a sign that denotes "7", according to a set of rules (arithmatic). While they are not real in the sense that they are present as objects in a physical world In the number-world these signs are "real" things. %%weak, be claer about ontpologocal status of numbers%%In other digital tools ans espacially LLMs, the tool may operate on a set of tokens that are not a sign in the Peircean sense, since they do not encode anything. They iperate on placeholders( look up Peter-Paul Verbeek, Roberto Confalonieri & Giancarlo Guizzardi, Rémy Demichelis, Kenneth Baclawski)
## Don Ihde's relationships- Embodiment relations
- Hermeneutic relations (interpretation though measurement) must be _read_
- Alterity relations (the tool is an "other")
- Background relationsDemichelis on Ihde" "Our understanding of the object is then inseparable from the medium without which we could not know it". When we use instruments, our relationship with the word is mediated BY THE TOOL. But at least t he instrument measure some physical property. %%dubious, is IQ what an IQ test measures or is is a property of humans? %% The “property” is operationally defined by the tool.But what we give an LLM is language, not a thing whose physocal properties it can measure) we give it a set of representamen, and the LLM works on a tokenized( thus doubly symbolic) representation of something that has meaning for us, but it is twice (Peirce might say thrice) removed from that meaning.  **LLMs are not hermeneutic instruments in Ihde’s sense.** They are _meta-hermeneutic engines_ — operating on already symbolic material, without direct access to the world.We might say that LLMs do not have tool-relations in the traditional sense, also do not have hermeneutic relations in Ihde's sense, but they are meta-hermenutic machines. Are those  the altertity relations? I don't think so. # Other relationships (non-Ihde)
When a tool operates on a model rather than a thing (as in a bevel tool in a cad application for example), the relationship with the thing the tool operates on exists in the model wrld, both the thing it operates on–a solid or 3d polygonal shape–AND the bevel tool itself are models. # What tools doDemichelis: "Interpretation, an activity we long believed was reserved for humans, is now being undertaken by digital tools" The "tools" he is referring to is chatGPT. But what is it interpreting–the material it operates on? 

# Reading Floridi
three interconnected theses concerning the philosophical, ethical, and socio-political implications of the digital and analogue relationship
1. digital representations (models) increasingly mediate our cognitive and practical engagement with reality (systems), resulting in epistemic abstraction and potential oversights (“the eclipse of the analogue”). 
2. at the same time and only apparently paradoxically, analogue factors are becoming central to the control and governance of digital technologies (“the hardware turn”). Despite digitalisation’s rhetoric of immateriality and virtuality, power increasingly resides with those who control the analogue conditions of possibility underpinning the digital domain
3. a normative framework for addressing this twofold challenge.
we increasingly rely on digital _models_ to deal cognitively with analogue _systems_
the map (model) is not the territory (system)
human understanding of any reality is shaped by abstractions
_politically_ and _economically_, we increasingly control digital models not just in terms of their design, development, and delivery but,also in terms of their analogue conditions of possibility
the analogue makes the digital possible
avoid a misleading disconnect between 
(a) our epistemic experience of digital models and 
(b) our practical interactions with analogue systems 
as well as a twofold disempowerment about 
(c) the DDD of models and 
(d) the control of the systems that make them possible
 call “system” any reality in itself that is the referent of our interactions, whether epistemic or not.
 Models are the outcome of a process that is always and inevitably selective and interpretative
 models are the result of _abstraction_
 inevitable abstraction with a non-zero, irreversible loss of information: you cannot reconstruct the full cat only from the model.
 The only models that adequately represent reality are those that declare their limits (what they abstract) and purpose (what they abstract it for).
 when we interact with the world, we know models but experience systems.
  if you build something, that artefact is a system, a noumenon, a new piece of reality in itself, even if you will always know it only through some mediating model
  in Plato, realities as we experience them are implementations (systems) of previous models understood as _blueprints_, i.e., the sources of the to-be-realised systems.
  Kant: our systems are now the _noumena_ (things-in-themselves), and our models are the _phenomena_ (the things-in-themselves as they appear to human cognitive experience)
systems are unknowable not in an _epistemically inaccessible_ sense, but as _epistemically inexhaustible sources_ of data that become information through cognitive processes that generate models
mediation represents a constructive elaboration of signals sent by the noumena, which are not descriptions of them.
Language represents reality in that it models it through logical structure, not in the sense that it directly reflects it.
digital models may prioritise abstract representations (models) over the immediacy of lived experience (systems and their interactions), and a dangerous disconnection from the tangible world may emerge, as we increasingly engage only with mediated, digital environments,
Baudrillard’s models without modelled systems (“copies without originals”) that become self-sufficient, creating their own reality rather than representing something external or authentic.
Approach the system-model distinction from a _mimetic_ perspective
 knowledge as representing the known object, not as making it
 See Horkheimer on how models mediate and obscure systems in a culture industry that standardises and commodifies cultural production.
 Weil provides an insightful analysis of tools as mediators of human labour and experience.
 In _Oppression and Liberty_ (1955), Weil analyzes tools as **mediators of human labour and experience**.
 deracinement as distinct from alientation
 epistemologically, a bias in favour of models rather than systems, is reinforced and accelerated by the enabling opportunities offered by the boundless malleability of the digital when compared to the analogue.
 entities that not only represent (“stand for”) but also replace (“stand in for”) the things and experiences they signify %%Ontologically, the proxy displaces the system it refers to.%%
 those who look at the shadows in the cave, are biased by their idols, and believe in metaphysical narratives, are controlled by those who control the analogue means of production of such content
Paideía (παιδεία)
Nomos ()
Cybernetics (κυβερνητική)
models, (mind, _by default_) are a feature, not a bug, part of the solution, not the problem, because they are enriching, epistemic mediations through which we can investigate, understand, and design realities

# reading Weil

We know Marx’s terrible utterances on this subject: “In craftsmanship and fabrication by hand, the worker makes use of the tool; in the factory, he is at the service of the machine.”

As a matter of fact, there was still, not so long ago, a class of workmen who, although wage-earners, were not simply living cogs in the service of the machines, but on the contrary carried out their work while using machines with as much freedom, initiative and intelligence as the craftsmen who wields his tool; these were the skilled workmen.

All tools are thus, in a more or less perfect way, in the manner of instruments for defining chance events.

For example, a workman who has a large enough garden to supply himself with vegetables is more independent than those of his comrades who have to get all their food from the shopkeepers; an artisan who has his own tools is more independent than a factory worker whose hands become useless as soon as it pleases the boss to stop him from working his machine.

But other forms of the machine-tool have produced—above all before the war—perhaps the finest type of conscious worker history has ever seen, namely, the skilled workman. If, in the course of the last twenty years, the machine-tool has become more and more automatic in its functioning, if the work carried out, even on machines of relatively ancient design, has become more and more mechanical, the reason lies in the ever-increasing concentration of the economy. Who knows whether an industry split up into innumerable small undertakings would not bring about an inverse development of the machine-tool, and, at the same time, types of work calling for a yet greater consciousness and ingenuity than the most highly skilled work in modern factories?

Marxism can only remain something living on one condition, which is that the precious tool constituted by the Marxist method should come down from generation to generation without getting rusty, each generation making use of it in order to define the world in which it lives.%%historical materialism is tool for thought. The operand(s):
lived reality
structures of exploitation
conditions of necessity
class relations
institutions
power structures.
historical processes

Can we say that the telos end (goal) is understanding or resolving apparent contradictions in relationships between the entities under consideration?
 %%

There is a legitimate and an illegitimate use of contradiction. The legitimate use lies, first of all, when two incompatible thoughts present themselves to the mind, in exhausting all the powers of the intellect in an attempt to eliminate at least one of them. If this is impossible, if both must be accepted, the contradiction must then be recognized as a fact. It must then be used as a two-limbed tool, like a pair of pincers, so that through it direct contact may be made with the transcendental sphere of truth beyond the range of the human faculties. The contact is direct, though made through an intermediary, in the same way as the sense of touch is directly affected by the uneven surface of a table over which you pass, not your hand, but your pencil. %%Objection: contradictions are projection artifacts that resolve in higher dimensions%%

# method as tool
In greek we might say the subject, hypokeímenon (ὑποκείμενον) uses the method, méthodos (μέθοδος) in a process, prâxis (πρᾶξις) on an operand, pragma (πρᾶγμα) towards  a goal, télos (τέλος).

> “Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.” —Peirce
