On LinkedIn (OK, who reads that?) you can read things like:

The "perfect" tool is the one that it's available by the client and solves their problems.

About that. No, the perfect tool is not whatever you happen to have at hand. A swiss army knife is a bad screwdriver. A wrench is not a a good substitute for a hammer. A nail gun is a substitute for a hammer. It makes putting nails in lumber much faster, but if you use a nail gun, you'll STILL use a hammer when the head of the nail is not quite flush with the piece. You'll use the claw to pull out a misfired nail. You'll use something like a palm nailer when there's no space.  You'll use a specific type on nailer, a finish nailer or a framing nailer or a roofing nailer.  You cannot rip a piece of lumber with a  nailer or a hammer., that;'s wahat a (again, specialized) saw is for

A thing that you call a tool is not a tool if it can be replaced by anything.

A tool cannot be replaced unless it is a specific.

Software applications are not tools. You can substitute Excel with Google Sheets or Numbers or Open Office. They're the supposedly the same thing, just from a different vendor. But if you know how to use one, you do not know how to use the other.  

But a Bostich Framing nailer is almost the same as a Metabo, or a Paslode, or a Milwaukee. Even if one is pneumatic, the other cordless and another gas-powered, it takes no effort to switch between them.

A tool is so narrowly defined by its use that variation is almost non-existent. Sure, I might prefer a Stiletto hammer to an Estwing, but they are completely equivalent on the job. I can replace one with the other instantly and not experience any delay or other difficulty on the job.  

Not so with software. Software has a use-paradigm that is not transparent across categories of vendors.  

Perhaps, you might say, software better described as a collection of tools, and a spreadsheet for example has a function that calculates the mean of set of values, and all spreadsheets have that same function. Once you know what a mean is, you can use that anywhere. Except that each mean() might be implemented differently. Does the mean() take one single vector as an argument, or a list, or just two floats? And do they return the arithmetic mean, or the geometric mean, or the harmonic mean? 

A utensil is not a tool. Why not? Both are implements. [Carus](https://archive.org/details/philosophytool00carugoog) says Lazarus Geiger has proposed a good classification of human activities. He distinguishes between tools, utensils, and weapons. 

" Those three categories form an analogon to the famous conception of the Hindu religion according to which the active All-being of the world manifests itself in three factors, as Brahma the creator, Vishnu the conservator and sustainer, and Siwa the destroyer. "The tool corresponds to the creative principle. The utensil serves the preservation of life."  

Per Carus: A tool is any implement employed for rendering work effective. 
Tool (hammer): creative principle
Utensil (table, cup); conservation
Weapon: destruction

Geiger uses the terms "Geräthe", "Werkzeuge" und "Waffen", Carus uses "Utensils", "Tools", "Weapons".

It's interesting that today we use the word appliance for the machine equivalent of a utensil, a (domestic) implement.

### Carus vs. Heidegger

- **Carus:** Tools converge toward prototypes because there is a most efficient way to perform the act. The prototype embodies the essence of the activity.
- **Heidegger:** Tools uncover the world by withdrawing into use. Their essence is not efficiency but their role in a network of practices. 

Some hundred years ago, the director of the Gazelle bicycle factory claimed %% find that quote again %% that bicycles had reached their ideal form and could not be made any more perfect.

The assumption that there was such a prototype form seems to have been pretty common back then. 

The bikes that Gazelle  made back then still exist, as "retro bikes", nearly unchanged.  But they've added new categories of more specialized bicycles. These don't have the same essence. A hundred years ago, the essence of a bicycle was that it was human-powered. If we are "essentialists", we have to confront the fact that the emergence of e-bikes has either changed the essence of what a bike is, or that they are (essentially) not bicycles.
