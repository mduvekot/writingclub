for bad science to persist and continue, you need 
1. a core of ethically or methodologically compromised people (who are willing to fabricate data or create misleading evidence)
2. a larger group of people who (for whatever reasons) are willing to set aside natural skepticism to promote these ideas

I dunno, we seem to have a few (conflicting?) tendencies
1. we succumb to peer pressure
2. a preference for counterintuitive obviousness (and books like "the tipping point")
3. imagining a deeper truth underneath a counterfactual
4. even specialists  are non-specialists in almost everything
5. it is easier to imagine yourself a skeptic than to be one
6. we find a low level of corruption desirable, because we expect to be its beneficiaries
7. it's OK to be a hypocrite

	"Correctness is easy to see, and it is straightforward to base security on special cases (depending on the parameters) of the GLWE assumptions (and one can find such prooffs of special cases in prior work)."
