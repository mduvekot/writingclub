Jen Christiansen, inspired by Lauren Klein and Tanvi Sharma, asks: "How (if at all) do you attempt to humanize with data if the story isn’t yours to tell?"

How do you know that the story isn't yours to tell? Some communities are better at conferring the rights to a storey than others.  What does it mean that a story is "yours"? Is that the same as the story of what happened to you? Or the story of how you became you? What would it be wrong fpor someone who is not you to tell, especially since you're probably not a reliable narrator. Perhaps it _is_ wrong to impose this NPOV on people's stories. And perhaps the outsider really does lack context to tel lthe story. And maybe objectivity is overrated (I find that tough to swallow).

Some stories may be (y)ours to tell, but only to some people
